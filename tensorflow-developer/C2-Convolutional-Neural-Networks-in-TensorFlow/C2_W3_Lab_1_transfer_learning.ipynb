This is called _transfer learning_ and you do this by leveraging the trained layers of an existing model and adding your own layers to fit your application. For example, you can:\n","\n","1. just get the convolution layers of one model\n","2. attach some dense layers onto it\n","3. train just the dense network\n","4. evaluate the results\n","\n","Doing this will allow you to save time building your application because you will essentially skip weeks of training time of very deep networks. You will just use the features it has learned and tweak it for your dataset. Let's see how these are done in the next sections."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Qvrr8pLRzJMV"},"source":["**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This notebook is designed to run as a Colab.
